	- Callback url: This is the url where the user of your app (you) will be redirected back after successfully login/ authorize app to twitter. Make sure it contains "callback.php" at the end of the url. Example: "http://example.com/yourapp/callback.php". Or "http://127.0.0.1/yourapp/callback.php" if you are going to use your computer.

If you are using live server, then you can upload the script anywhere inside your site main directory/ root folder.
